# Time-series-Machine-Learning
Time series forecasting, anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction

### forecast .ipynb
Implementation of LSTM neural net to predict values of stocks over time. Train the model using 1 stock and predicting it's values, or concatenating multiple stocks and predicting unknown values of a stock used in the training set.

### detect .ipynb
Anomaly detection

### reduce. ipynb
Implementation of encoder using CNN. Our goal is to minimize the dimensions, without losing necessary information about the time-series.
